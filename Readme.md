# Simulating neutron stars

Results and experiments in simulating neutron stars with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net).

- Go through the Summer School project by prof. Andrew Cumming
- Simulate these different stars to make sure everything works fine:
    1. Neutron star with accretion rate of $2\times10^{-11}$
    2. Neutron star with diffusion, but no accretion
- Simulate a neutron star with accretion & diffusion (by Friday November 7)
- Simulate neutron stars with accretion rates between $2\times10^{-11}$ and $2\times10^{-10}$, with and without diffusion (by Friday November 14)
- Compare the following with results from the 2007 Peng paper (by Friday November 21)
    - Sedimentation & accretion velocities
    - Figures of one zone model

## Summer School Lecture

The lecture can [be found on the MESA website](http://mesastar.org/teaching-materials/2015-mesa-summer-school/cumming), and at `Summer school` in the repo. I'll go through the minilab.

## Tests

### Accretion rate of $2\times10^{-11}$

### Diffusion only

## Accretion & diffusion

## Various accretion rates

## Comparisons to figures & paper
