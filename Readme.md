# Simulating neutron stars

Results and experiments in simulating neutron stars with [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net).

- [] Go through the Summer School project by prof. Andrew Cumming
- [] Simulate these different stars to make sure everything works fine:
    1. Neutron star with accretion rate of 2e-11
    2. Neutron star with diffusion, but no accretion
- [] Simulate a neutron star with accretion & diffusion (by Friday November 7)
- [] Simulate neutron stars with accretion rates between 2e-11 and 2e-11, with and without diffusion (by Friday November 14)
- [] Compare the following with results from the 2007 Peng paper (by Friday November 21)
    - Sedimentation & accretion velocities
    - Figures of one zone model
